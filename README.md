# Guest Book - API

Full Stack Capstone Project using React/Redux & NodeJS/Express/MongoDB

## [Live Demo](https://guestbook.netlify.com)

## Introduction
---

The idea came about from by all the weddings, birthdays and other events I have attended in the past year or will be attending this year and found it difficult to have to dig up that old email invitation or the paper invitation as a guest. As a someone who has manned a few guest check-in tables at weddings, I found challenge of tracking who attended, who gave what give, and the task of writing thank-you cards rather daunting. The original idea was for the app to generate RSVP emails to the guest and then remindar emails 3 days and on day of the event. Then on the day of the actual event, check-in guests and add comments to track gifts and what not. However, due to time and to keep as a MVP, I will have to revisit the email API and checking in of guests for v2.
